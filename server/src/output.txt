Biographical Briefing on Aristotle

Aristotle was born in 384 BC
in Stagira, a small township in
northemn Greece. His father, a
physician at the royal court of
Macedonia, died while his son
was still young. Aristotle then
left Stagira to study at Plato’s
Academy in Athens. For the
next 20 years, Aristotle studied
with Plato, a renowned Greek
philosopher, and the circle of
philosophers at the Academy.
After Plato’s death in 347 BC,
Aristotle left the Academy and traveled in Greece and Asia
Minor, writing and studying in academic circles. His writing
covers a wide range of subjects: logic, physics, astronomy,
biology, ethics, politics, rhetoric (public speaking), and
literary criticism. In 342 BC, King Philip of Macedonia
asked Arstotle to become the tutor of Philip’s son,
Alexander, who later became the conqueror Alexander the
Great. When Alexander became king, Adstofle left
Macedonia and returned to Athens, where he began his own
school named the Lyceum. After Alexander’s death in 323

 

in a polis, humans can be the best of all creatures. Asistotle
believed that only through society and governmeat could
people realize their full potential,

In his work or Poftiss, Adistotle described three
positive forms of government: monarchy (rule by a king or
queen), aristocracy (rule by the noble or wealthy class), and
constitutional rule (rule by the people). He believed that
monarchy and asistoctacy ate good forms of government as
long as the rulers ate virtuous. If the rulers are not virtuous,
monarchy and asstocracy can become negative and
dangerous. This happens when rulers selfishly use their
power to increase their own wealth, rather than to foster
(support) the common good. Aristotle believed democracy
is the least dangerous form of government. His main
concern with democracy was that because people have equal
freedom, they might think they are equal in every way and
fail to recognize their different strengths and weaknesses.
Since some people are better educated 2nd more suited to
have political power, Adstotle argued that a belief in total
equality would harm the society in general.

Aristotle believed that the ideal society is one in
which everyone is educated to be morally virtuous, and all
citizens participate in political society. He thought that the

 

BC, the Athenians became hostile to
Macedonian rule. Because of his
connections with Alexander and the
Macedonian govemment, Aristotle fled
Athens in 324 BC, in fear of his life.
Aristotle died the next year on the

 

island of Euboea.

Aristotle considered language
and speech to be crifically important
since the ability to reason comes from
the use of language. Reason, Aristotle
claimed, is what distinguishes humans
from animals. Aristotle thought that
people are not born virtuous, but learn
to be good. Parents teach children right
from wrong by punishing them for
wrong actions. It is through reason, he
proposed, that children learn to separate
tight from wrong and are able to leam
moral values. Aristotle believed that
over time, humankind evolves to higher
and higher forms of development. The
development of the pofis (political
community or society) represents the

 

 

best form of government would be
rle by properly-educated members
of the middle class. Power, he
believed, should be given to the
middle class because people in this
class are free of the excesses found in
the upper and lower classes. He
thought that while the rich are too
arrogant and the poor may be
vengeful, the middle class can more
easily be stable and rational.
However, he also realized that this
ideal is almost impossible to achieve.
In his time, kings held most of the
power, so Aristotle favored a system
where kings would take advice on
ruling from philosophers. He wrote
in On Kingship, “[It is] not merely
unnecessary for a king to be a
philosopher, but even a disadvantage.
Rather a king should take advantage
of true philosophers. Then he would
fill his reign with good deeds, not
with good words.” By separating the

 

 

highest stage in this development. People exercising reason
can join together in societies through their understanding
that the common good is more important than individual
good. In the absence of society and law and order, Adstotle
thought, humans become selfish and evil. Yet when unified

philosophers from direct rule, Aristotle hoped to keep the
philosophers independent in spirit. He felt Lhat( if the
philosophers could not become wealthy from a position of
direct power, they would be more honest.
