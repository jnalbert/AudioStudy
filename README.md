# AudioStudy

This app was created for The 2021 Congressional App Challenge and won second place in this competition. 
The mobile app focuses on improving the effectiveness and speed of studying for students with reading impairments, such as dyslexia or visual impairments. 
It allows the user to take a picture of any printed or handwritten text. That image will then be sent to a Firebase cloud function, which will use GCP's OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the image to text characters. The text characters will then be converted to speech using GCP's TTS (Text-To-Speech) API, and the file will then be stored in the cloud and be accessible on any device the user is logged in on.
